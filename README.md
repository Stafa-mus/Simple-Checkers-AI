# Simple-Checkers-AI
A simple implementation of checkers game using python and pygame, and the easyAI library. Requires python and pygame. Install pygame using "pip install pygame"
The game is not perfect, and it is easy to win, but it is a good starting point for future improvements. Admittedly, the interface is not as fancy as a user 
might expect, but is is also a good starting point.
Threads are not used, so as the game progresses, it might freeze ocassionally for very few seconds, depending on the computer being used.
Happy playing.
After installing python and pygame, simply run main.py.
